ai vs fake classification model
In today's digital age, the ability to distinguish between real and synthetic images has become increasingly crucial, especially with the rise of deepfake technology. Deepfakes, which utilize advanced machine learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can generate highly realistic but artificial images that pose significant challenges in terms of authenticity verification.

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model trained on the CIFake dataset to classify images as either real or AI-generated (synthetic). The model's task is to analyze given images and accurately determine their origin, providing insights into whether they are authentic representations or artificially generated simulations.

Using Python, we constructed a classification model employing techniques typical in machine learning, such as CNNs. Our model achieved impressive performance metrics including a 92% accuracy rate, as indicated by the classification report matrix encompassing precision and other relevant metrics.
